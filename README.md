# NerdProject
As a nerd, I'm always curious about which companies have most job vacancies (in data analysis field) in Canada or which province has what kind of job categoreis (such as IT). So, here it comes. This project (or a series of small projects) deployed based on the raw data extracted from Adzuna, which is a third party job platform based in UK parsing and gathering data from other job webs, such as Indeed, Glassdoor and LinkedIn, etc. It supplies the RESTful API, therefore, I can get the data in a clean and neat format (in json) in a safe and efficient way. And also, all the job data are already or going to be available in public (that's why they supply an API interface), there won't be any privacy issues. So, I put the code for my personal projects right here.
